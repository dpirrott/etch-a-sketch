# Etch-A-Sketch
Simple project created as directed from The Odin Project. 

The goal was to create a 16x16 size adjustable grid where users can draw with their mouse passing over the squares. I went for the added challenge of generating random colors with each pass, as well as 10% black with each of the following passes on the colored square.
